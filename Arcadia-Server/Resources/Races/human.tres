race_description_short = "Humans are mid-sized, mostly-hairless creatures, often with a skin color ranging from extremely pigmented skin to non-pigmented skin with a wide variety of distinctive features, such as hair color, eye color, stature, and voice. One of the most adaptable species on Arcadia, humans can be found in effectively all climates, and while not particularly gifted in the realm of magic, humans are noted for being clever and adapting the physical world to their needs, and innovating where they cannot adapt."
race_description_extended = "[indent][b]Humanity[/b][/indent] is perhaps the third-oldest species on Arcadia, descended from Tiaos's initial creation. They were never particularly touched by any one Divine, and were never intended to fill a particular niche, being a productive of evolution. In this void, Humans have instead developed to adapt themselves to their enviroment, and are capable of thriving in a wide variety of climates ranging from temperate forests to the hottest deserts.

[indent]Humans[/indent] are no more or no less capable of magic than many other creatures, however, extant human societies are deeply supersititous of magic, and social pressure has largely forced their societial development away from reliance on the arcane and towards conventional approaches - human nations often loft their progress in scientific and industrial fields to the forefront of their presentation to the world, and this approach has allowed the relatively young human nations to actively compete with the older powers of the world - often at great cost, however, as these young nations discover that conflict and glory are rarely so easy."
